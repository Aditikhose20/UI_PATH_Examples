Data Type Example:

 For Generic Data type: This can store any kind of dat alike text , number, arrays
 They automatically converted to other data type in order to perform certain actions.
 but there conversion not always corrected

 EX:  
 when u trying to add two generic values, and if the first one is defined ad string and second one is number then the result is concatnation of this two number
 but if,
 if the first one is defined as number and second one is string then result is addition of this two number
if a= 2 and  b="2" Then Result= 4
but,
if a="2"  and b=2 Then Result=22
